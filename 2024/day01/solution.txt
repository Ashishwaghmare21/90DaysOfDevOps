 1] What is DevOps 

--> -  The term DevOps is a combination of two words: development and operation 
    -  DevOps is a methodology that allows a single team to manage the entire  application development life cycle, which includes development, testing, deployment, and operation 
    -  The objective of DevOps is to shorten the system development life cycle 
    -  DevOps is a software development approach through which superior quality software can be developed quickly and with more reliability

2] What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure

--> 1. Automation
               Definition: Automation is the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention.
        Purpose:
                Increases efficiency and speed
                Reduces human error
                Frees up human resources for higher-value work
       Examples:
                Automating server deployments with tools like Ansible or Terraform
                Automated testing in software development (e.g., using CI/CD pipelines
                Scheduling jobs or workflows using cron jobs or orchestration platforms

   2. Scaling
              Definition: Scaling refers to a system's ability to handle increased workload by adding resources.
        Types:
              Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): Increasing the capacity of a single machine (e.g., adding more RAM or CPU)
              Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out): Adding more machines or instances to a system
        Purpose:
                Improves performance and availability as demand grows
                Ensures systems remain responsive under load
        Examples:
                Adding more web servers to handle increased traffic
                Using cloud services like AWS Auto Scaling
  3. Infrastructure
           Definition: Infrastructure is the underlying foundation (physical and virtual) that supports computing systems.
       Components:
           Hardware: Servers, data centers, storage devices, network equipment
            Software: Operating systems, virtualization platforms, container orchestration tools (like Kubernetes)
            Cloud Infrastructure: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
     Purpose:
            Provides the environment where applications run
            Ensures reliability, security, and performance of services
       Examples:
               Cloud infrastructure setup for a SaaS platform
               On-premises data center for enterprise applications


    Why DevOps is Important

--> DevOps is Important because it's a  software deployment and operation approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing 
    deployments
